        <h2>Before You Start Reading</h2>
        <p>
            This document is not a step-by-step guide on how to sketch a user interface. Instead, think of it as a kickstarter to help you get going. Thank you!

        <h2>Why Is Sketching a User Interface a Good Idea?</h2>
        <p>
            Sketching the user interface (UI) before development can be very helpful, especially for complex applications like an electric scooter rental app. It allows your team and stakeholders to quickly understand how the interface might look and function, without needing long explanations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sketching can also reveal potential issues in the user experience (UX) early, so they can be fixed before any code is written. This approach encourages you to think through the user’s journey in the app, leading to a design that’s more focused on their needs.

        <h2>How to Choose a Tool for Sketching UI</h2>
        <p>
            There are many tools available for sketching user interfaces, and the right choice depends on a few factors:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your experience with visualizing ideas and arranging elements like shapes and text</li>
            <li>Your understanding of graphic design concepts</li>
            <li>Your timeframe for completing the sketch</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You can start by searching for popular sketching tools and exploring their features. In this report, I will be using two free web-based platforms, Figma and MockFlow (both offer free plans with some limitations).
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.figma.com" target="_blank">Figma</a>: A widely used tool for sketching and prototyping UIs; it is considered the industry standard.</li>
            <li><a href="https://mockflow.com" target="_blank">MockFlow</a>: An intuitive, drag-and-drop tool for creating UI designs quickly and easily.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I assume that you have created an account on the following services: Figma and MockFlow.</li>
            <li>I will use one requirement specification translated to English from 
                <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zWksQNmkXJgM7Q66k3-mgcxrexO6eF9xqd0Z632BwlU/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.l3doj0ee6ekb" target="_blank">Kravspecification Svenska Elsparkcyklar AB (2024)</a>. 
                The requirement is listed below. I have broken it down to fit the goal of sketching a UI.
